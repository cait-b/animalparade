                <br>
                <p>
                    After being dropped off by Cain, and being told by Hamilton you have to pay him 5000 G for the farm land, talk and visit with the people in Castanet. You'll find out that things are not doing so well. No one comes to Harmonica Town anymore, so Jake and Colleen are pretty depressed. Any fires that are made on the island are too weak to be useful. Without a fire nothing can be cooked, so Maya, Chase, and Yolanda are sad. Crops are not doing well, so that impacts Craig and Ruth. You'll also discover that some of the villagers have gone away to study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you visit Simon at his Harmonica Photography Studio, he will give you a free Camera. Now you can take pictures within your game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, visit the animal barn at Horn Ranch. Cain will be inside and give you a free small cow. You can choose between a black, black & white spotted, or brown cow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Harvest Sprite companion, Finn, wants you to visit the Goddess Pond as soon as possible. The pond is located up the mountain in the Garmon Mine District, and you can take the path behind your farm to get there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you follow the mountain path you'll run into Bo, the apprentice carpenter. The boy is faced with the task of repairing the bridge to the Garmon Mine District. Unfortunately he didn't bring his carpenter's tool box. Bo asks you to talk to Mayor Hamilton to retrieve it. You'll find Hamilton in the Town Hall, just on the other side of the bridge next to Simon's photography studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in Harmonica Town, Hamilton will request that you talk to everyone, if you haven't done so already, before he gives you the tool box. Most of the people can be found inside their shops, but there are some tricky ones:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jake and Colleen - At the end of the pier at the dock
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Toby - Under the waterwheel in Flute Fields
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chase - Go to the Chelsta Church Grounds lookout point
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you have finished meeting everyone, return to the Town Hall and Hamilton will give you the tool box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take the tool box back to Bo at the bridge. Now he can get to work but he's really hungry! Bo requests that you bring him a Strawberry and some Milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can buy Decent Milk at Horn Ranch for 340 G and a Decent Strawberry at Marimba Farm for 360 G. Both of these shops in the Flute Fields are closed on Wednesdays. Give Bo both items and he'll be able to start repairing the bridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note!</b> The "Hot Milk" you can buy from Horn Ranch is the <i>cooking recipe</i> and NOT milk you can give to Bo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next morning Bo will visit your house and tell you the repairs are completed. Now you can walk to the Garmon Mine District.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In between Dale's Carpentry and Barbara's General Store is the path that leads to the Goddess Pond. Down the path you'll discover that your way is blocked by wild animals! Finn suggests you talk to someone who knows about animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visit Dale at his Carpentry shop. He explains that you need to open your heart to the animals, and shows you the relationship he has with his dog, Boss. The two of them get along so well! Dale says that an Animal Whistle will help, but after searching his pockets he seems to have dropped it. Dale said he had it when he was near Barbara's shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talk to Barbara at her shop, but she hasn't seed a whistle. She suggests you talk to Julias.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Accessory shop is just past the little foot bridge. Inside, Julias said that he got the whistle from Simon (who found it on the ground), but then he gave it to Chloe. Julias also mentions the shop won't run unless Mira takes it over from her late husband, and she spends most of her time at the Chelsta Church. When ever you have a moment, walk back to the church and talk to Mira. She'll realize she's neglected the accessory shop and return to open it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next to the Accessories shop is the Blacksmith shop. Ramsey says that if Chloe had an orange whistle, she would of wanted to show it off to Owen. He suggests that you go look for Owen inside the mine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Owen can be found inside the Garmon Lower Mine on the 10th floor down. He says that Chloe does indeed have an orange whistle, but when she blew on it a bear and a boar appeared! He took it away from her because he feared for her safety. Owen will take the whistle out of his pocket and entrusts it to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Return to the wild animals blocking the path to the Goddess' Pond and use the Animal Whistle. The creatures will become delighted and move out of your way. Now you can go and visit the Harvest Goddess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the pond, Goddess explains the problem with the divine tree. The power of nature has faded, and if the 5 bells are not rung, then the land may soon be uninhabitable. The Goddess asked the Sprites to ring their bells, but she fears they have become too weak to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bells should be around the island but the Goddess does not know their exact location. You can always come back to the pond and she will give you what little information she knows.
