                    On the Classic Controller, the R button and Y button is not used.

                    One of the controls that is not documented in the instruction manual is the use of a second Wii Remote. You will move through the game using your primary controller, but you can enable a second remote in order to "rub" other characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you enable your second remote, a red-heart cursor will appear on the screen with "2P" written underneath it. Wave the heart cursor on top of the villagers to increase your friendship with them. You will want to "rub" before you give a gift or talk to the person, since the 2P heart seems to act as a bonus modifier that increases the affection earned for the gift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can "rub" on the villagers and <a href="pets.php">pets</a> you can befriend. For example, if you 2P double-rub, pat, pick up, and give a fish to the white cat in Harmonica Town on a daily basis, it will want to become a pet on your farm by the end of the first Spring season. Rubbing is very beneficial!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2P rub technique only seems to work one time on any livestock or poultry animals that you have living on your farm.
